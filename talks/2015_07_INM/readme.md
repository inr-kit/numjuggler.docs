Files to generate slides for the x-th ITER neutronics meeting talk.

The main source file is ``slides.md``. It is processed with ``pandoc`` to tex,
which is then processed with pdflatex to obtain ``slides.pdf``. External files
(examples of invocation and input files) are taken from the ``examples``
folder. It contains only bash scripts and original input files; the modified
input files are generated by the scripts, thus the ``numjuggler`` package must
be installed. 

Inclusion of external files is not supported directly by the markdown format.
For that, markdown is diluted with LaTeX code. Therefore, the only target
format is tex and pdf.

There are additional tex files that are necessary to apply the KIT style,
``preamble.tex`` and ``b_preamble.tex``. The KIT style latex package must be
installed separately; distribution files can be found on the KIT intranet. The
KIT logo and the title image are stored in ``logos``. Dependence on KIT style
package that can be obtained only from within the KIT intranet means that
outside users will not be able to generate pdf from the sources. But this
should be simple to remove dependencies on KIT style.

The ``make`` utility governs generation process, see ``Makefile`` files in
current folder and in ``examples``. If everything is settled, calling ``make``
from the current folder should do the job. In any case, the resulting pdf file
is also stored in repo, ``slides.pdf``.
